# Magic-8-ball-in-Python

## Introduction
Experience the thrill of the unknown with the "Magic 8-Ball", a Python3 project that replicates the age-old fortune-telling toy in the digital realm. Initially sparked by Codecademy's Python 3 online lesson, this version delves deeper into the core of Python's conditional logic and randomization techniques. It's more than just a fun appâ€”it's a learning journey.

## Features
Timeless Responses: Relive the suspense with iconic answers like "Yes", "No", "Maybe", and several others.
Randomized Fortunes Using If/Else: Dive into Python's conditional logic with the program's use of if/else statements to determine the 8-ball's answer.
Random Number Generation: Understand the power and unpredictability of Python's random number generation, ensuring every shake offers a unique outcome.

## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run the program with the command python3 magic8ball.py.
Input your question and name in the global varibles at the top of the file
Shake again and again for more answers!

## Learning Objectives
